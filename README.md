# pubmed-to-word

This is a python script to convert the citations created by PubMed by clicking on 'Send to:' and then 'Citation Manager' (citations.nbib) to an XML file compatible with the built-in MSWord reference manager. The resulting XML file can be opened from the 'Manage sources..." dialog box.
